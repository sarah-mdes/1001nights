<p id="text1">In another 1001 Nights tale, “Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman”, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater submarine society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other Arabian Nights tales also depict Amazon societies dominated by women, lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.[60] “The City of Brass” features a group of travellers on an archaeological expedition[61] across the Sahara to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that Solomon once used to trap a jinn,[62] and, along the way, encounter a mummified queen, petrified inhabitants,[63] life-like humanoid robots and automata, seductive marionettes dancing without strings,[64] and a brass horseman robot who directs the party towards the ancient city,[65] which has now become a ghost town.[55] “The Ebony Horse” features a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun.[66] Some modern interpretations see this horse as a robot.[65] The titular ebony horse can fly the distance of one year in a single day, and is used as a vehicle by the Prince of Persia [disambiguation needed ], Qamar al-Aqmar, in his adventures across Persia, Arabia and Byzantium. This story appears to have influenced later European tales such as Adenes Le Roi’s Cleomades and “The Squire’s Prologue and Tale” told in Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales.[67] “The City of Brass” and “The Ebony Horse” can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.[68] The “Third Qalandar’s Tale” also features a robot in the form of an uncanny boatman.[65]</p>

<p class="three">Several stories within the One Thousand and One Nights feature early science fiction elements. One example is “The Adventures of Bulukiya”, where the protagonist Bulukiya’s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, journey to Paradise and to Hell, and travel across the cosmos to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of galactic science fiction;[57] along the way, he encounters societies of djinns,[58] mermaids, talking serpents, talking trees, and other forms of life.[57] In “Abu al-Husn and His Slave-Girl Tawaddud”, the heroine Tawaddud gives an impromptu lecture on the mansions of the Moon, and the benevolent and sinister aspects of the planets.[59]</p>
<p class="one">An example of the murder mystery[48] and suspense thriller genres in the collection, with multiple plot twists[49] and detective fiction elements[50] was “The Three Apples”, also known as Hikayat al-sabiyya ‘l-muqtula (”The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman”),[51] one of the tales narrated by Scheherazade in the One Thousand and One Nights. In this tale, Harun al-Rashid, comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, Ja’far, three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja’far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman’s husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman’s murder. Harun then gives Ja’far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja’far’s own slave, Rayhan. Thus the mystery is solved.</p>
