<p class="a1"> He is shocked to discover that his brother’s wife is unfaithful; discovering his own wife’s infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her executed: but in his bitterness and grief decides that all women are the same. The king, Shahryar, begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonour him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade, the vizier’s daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, <a class="link1" href="four.html">Scheherazade</a> begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins (and only begins) a new one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again. So it goes on for 1,001 nights.</p>

<p class="a2"> The modern fame of the Nights derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to Robert Irwin,Galland “played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the Nights.”[79] The immediate success of Galland’s version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for contes de fées (”fairy stories”). This fashion began with the publication of Madame d’Aulnoy’s Histoire d’Hypolite in 1690. D’Aulnoy’s book has a remarkably similar structure to the Nights, with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the Nights spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.[80] Galland’s version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include Anthony Hamilton’s Les quatre Facardins (1730), Crébillon’s Le sopha (1742) and Diderot’s Les bijoux indiscrets (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is Voltaire’s Zadig (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.[81] The English versions of the “Oriental Tale” generally contained a heavy moralising element,[82] with the notable exception of William Beckford’s fantasy Vathek (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the Gothic novel. The Polish nobleman Jan Potocki’s novel Saragossa Manuscript (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the Nights with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.[83]
The Nights was a favourite book of many British authors of the Romantic and Victorian eras. According to A. S. Byatt, “In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.” [84] In their autobiographical writings, both Coleridge and de Quincey refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. Wordsworth and Tennyson also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.[85] Charles Dickens was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the Nights pervades the opening of his last novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870).[86]
Several writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,[87] including Théophile Gautier (La mille deuxième nuit, 1842)[75] and Joseph Roth (Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht, 1939).[87] Edgar Allan Poe wrote “The Thousand and Second Tale of Scheherazade” (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of Sinbad the Sailor, along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain—except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle—that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe’s lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.
Modern authors influenced by the Nights include James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Jorge Luis Borges and John Barth.</p>
